# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

- The purpose of this project was to use neural networks and machine learning in order to create a binary classifier that would help us determine the success of those applicants that received help from the Alphabet Soup charity would be successful. We were provided a data set containing over 30,000 organizations that had previously received funding to aid us in our analysis. 

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
** What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? **
- The variable that would be considered the target of our model is the column that is labeled "IS_SUCCESSFUL

** What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? **
- The variables that are considered to be featured are Application Type, Affiliation, Classification, Use Case, Organization, Status, Income Amount, Special Considerations and Ask Amount
- The variables that are not features are the ones we dropped from the data set, which were EIN and Name

** What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? **
- The variables that were neither targets nor features, as mentioned above and removed from the input data, were EIN and Name


### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
